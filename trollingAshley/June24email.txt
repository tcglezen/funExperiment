Greetings Mrs. Yang, 

thanks for recognizing that I am great at spelling, it's not a compliment that I get often! However, being honest, I was only able to spell 'exquisite' correctly because of spell check XD. I'm also going to be in Music26 AC. As for my other classes, I think I might do EE16B, Math110, and Stat 135. However, that's a hit or miss. 

Yours truly, 
Thomas Glezen 

ps. writing this email was a lot of fun ^w^
